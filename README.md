## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (version 18.x or higher)
* **npm** or **Yarn** package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextwork-frontend.git
   cd nextwork-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   VITE_BACKEND_API_URL="http://localhost:8099/api"
   VITE_SOCKET_URL="http://localhost:8099"
   VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN="dev-sss.us.auth0.com"
   VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="your-auth0-client-id"
   ```
   
   **Note:** Replace `http://localhost:8099` with your actual backend URL if deployed elsewhere.

### Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Running with Docker

You can also run the application using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t nextwork-frontend .
   ```

2. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 nextwork-frontend
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Deployment

The frontend is automatically deployed using **GitHub Actions** to **Azure App Service** or **Azure Static Web Apps**. The deployment process uses Docker containerization with **Nginx** as the web server to ensure consistent environments from development to production with high performance and load balancing capabilities.

### Deployment Pipeline

1. Code push triggers GitHub Actions
2. Docker image is built and tested
3. Application is deployed to Azure infrastructure
4. Production environment is updated
